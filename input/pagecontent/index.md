# Period Tracking MVP Implementation Guide

This draft defines a deliberately small FHIR R4 exchange model for **patient-generated menstrual period tracking data**, plus a complete, working path for getting that data from a tracking app into a clinician's hands: export as FHIR, share as an encrypted **SMART Health Link**, and render in a **privacy-preserving client-side viewer**. The included viewer is a reference/default implementation; apps and provider systems can host their own viewer, use an EHR-integrated scanner, or exchange bare `shlink:/...` values. The guide is designed for a first interoperable implementation across structurally different mobile and web apps.

## The whole system at a glance

1. **Model** — an app maps the data it actually stores to the Bundle profile and concrete fact profiles below. See the [Specification](specification.html) and the [FHIR mapping reference](fhir-mapping.html).
2. **Share** — the Bundle is encrypted into a [SMART Health Link](smart-health-links.html) (compact JWE; the file host never sees the key or plaintext).
3. **View** — a receiving app decrypts the link and renders a cycle summary, **computing all analytics from the granular facts** (no precomputed summaries travel in the Bundle). The site includes [reference clinician viewer variants](view.html) as compatible receivers.

### Try it now

- **Open the reference viewer:** [view.html](view.html) — the published site build includes the generated sample link next to the viewer.
- **Compare viewer variants:** [view2.html](view2.html) is a binary-first clinician view that derives the cycle picture from Layer 0 before showing optional overlays; [view3.html](view3.html) is a bleeding-first alternate that foregrounds Layer 0 extrapolations before optional overlays.
- Inspect the data behind it: the [longitudinal example Bundle](Bundle-period-tracking-longitudinal-example.html) (a synthetic seven-cycle copper-IUD case — the same data the viewer renders).
- The sample is published through the [reference viewer](view.html) as a viewer-prefixed SHLink because that is the most robust default for ordinary browser launch. A provider's dedicated receiving app can scan that same QR, ignore the viewer prefix, and process the embedded `shlink:/...` with its own display logic.

## The profiles

1. **[Period Tracking MVP Bundle](StructureDefinition-period-tracking-bundle.html)** — a FHIR `collection` Bundle scoped to one person's period-tracking data. It requires at least one bleeding core fact; Patient and Device resources are optional.
2. **[Period Tracking Fact Observation](StructureDefinition-period-tracking-fact.html)** — the abstract base profile for one independently meaningful granular fact.
3. **[Menstrual Bleeding Fact Observation](StructureDefinition-menstrual-bleeding-fact.html)** — the required boolean core fact.
4. **[Menstrual Flow Fact Observation](StructureDefinition-menstrual-flow-fact.html)** — optional ordinal flow intensity.
5. **[Symptom Fact Observation](StructureDefinition-symptom-fact.html)** — optional symptom facts with the specific symptom in `valueCodeableConcept`.
6. **[Numeric Pain Severity Fact Observation](StructureDefinition-numeric-pain-severity-fact.html)** — optional 0-10 pain score.
7. **[Basal Body Temperature Fact Observation](StructureDefinition-basal-body-temperature-fact.html)** — optional timed or day-scoped basal body temperature.

It defines one small [Menstrual Flow ValueSet](ValueSet-menstrual-flow.html), a non-binding [Common Period-Tracking Symptoms](ValueSet-common-tracker-symptoms.html) starter set, a small fact-category ValueSet, and a [project CodeSystem](CodeSystem-cycle.html) of exactly eight concepts. The universal Layer 0 core is `menstrual-bleeding` true/false at the source date or timestamp; standard LOINC, SNOMED CT, and UCUM are used for optional Layer 1 facts when the source meaning supports them.

## Adding support to a period-tracking app

Any menstrual, fertility, or cycle-tracking app — regardless of its internal data model — can adopt this IG. The work is mostly mapping the data you already store and choosing how to host the encrypted share.

When using an AI agent to add support, start with the [AI implementation skill](skill.html). It is the implementation checklist for inspecting real app data, mapping only stored facts, packaging an encrypted SHLink, and verifying the viewer/privacy path.

- **The skill** (a complete working method for agents) is browsable at [skill.html](skill.html) and downloadable as a self-contained [skill.zip](skill.zip). The zip maps this page to `SKILL.md`, includes the skill references, and includes the core spec markdown under `spec/`.
- **Reference implementation in the repo:** `viewer-src/` (the transform + viewer source) and `scripts/` (the `bun` generators that build the example Bundle, the SHL, and the viewer as build artifacts).
- **Hosting the share:** use an application backend or deployable blind SHLink service that can actually enforce revocation, expiry, use limits, passcodes, and access logs. See the [SMART Health Links reference](smart-health-links-implementation.html) for the implementation choices.

## Core rule

> Emit only information that the user entered, selected, verified, or measured. Absence of an Observation means **not recorded**, not **absent**.

An explicit negative may be exported only when the source can distinguish it from an untouched default. See [Scope and conformance principles](specification.html#scope-and-conformance-principles).

## What the MVP covers — and deliberately excludes

The MVP has three adoption layers. **Layer 0: Core bleeding facts** is required for compatibility: `menstrual-bleeding` true/false at the source date or timestamp. **Layer 1: Structured optional facts** adds patient-rated flow, symptoms, numeric pain severity, and basal body temperature when available. **Layer 2: Native archive** optionally adds a FHIR `Binary` holding the exact native JSON selected for sharing — a lossless safety net for source fields outside the normalized facts.

The MVP does **not** require normalized representations for predictions, cycle summaries, medication adherence, contraception lifecycle, detailed sexual activity, cervical mucus/examination, menstrual products, fertility tests, or app configuration. Apps may keep these in the native archive or add source-coded granular Observations; later versions can standardize what real clinical workflows prove necessary.

## Status

Version 0.1.0 is an implementation draft intended for prototyping and testing. It is not an HL7-balloted implementation guide and does not establish clinical decision rules. The data is patient-generated and is not cryptographically attested clinical content.
