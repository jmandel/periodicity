# SMART Health Links reference

A SMART Health Link (SHL) lets a user share the FHIR Bundle as an **encrypted file plus a key**, where the hosting server only ever sees ciphertext. The key travels inside the link (in the URL fragment), so a blind host — your CDN, an object store, or a third party — can never read the cycle data.

This page is a condensed, self-contained reference for the SHL wire format plus the sharing-UX and host guidance this IG adds. For the normative protocol, defer to the **SMART Health Links specification** (HL7 SMART Health Cards & Links IG) — read the source markdown: https://github.com/HL7/smart-health-cards-and-links/blob/main/input/pagecontent/links-specification.md. For Period Tracking MVP packaging specifics (share shape, lifetime, use-limit), see `input/pagecontent/smart-health-links.md` (published as `smart-health-links.html`).

## How a SMART Health Link works

An SHL is a small JSON payload, base64url-encoded after `shlink:/`, that points a receiver at **encrypted file(s)** and carries the **decryption key in the link fragment** so the host stays blind. The shareable form is `<viewer>/#shlink:/<b64url>`; the `#` fragment (key included) never reaches a server.

### The `shlink:/` payload

`shlink:/` + base64url(minified JSON), with these fields:

| field | req | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | ✓ | where the encrypted content lives. SHALL carry **≥256 bits of entropy** in its unguessable part (e.g. 32 random bytes → 43 base64url chars) and be **≤128 chars** total. |
| `key` | ✓ | base64url of **32 random bytes** — the AES-256 content key (43 chars). |
| `flag` | | zero or more of `L` (long-term, re-resolvable), `P` (passcode required), `U` (direct file). **`U` SHALL NOT combine with `P`.** |
| `label` | | human label, **≤80 chars**. |
| `exp` | | expiry, epoch seconds — an advisory staleness hint; real enforcement is the host's. |
| `v` | | version int, default 1. |

### Encryption

Each file is a **compact JWE** — `alg:"dir"`, `enc:"A256GCM"`, `cty` header = the payload's media type (`application/fhir+json` for a Bundle). Generate a **fresh random 96-bit IV from a CSPRNG for every encryption**, cap a single key at ~2³² messages, then rotate keys — the simplest correct discipline is a **fresh key per share**, so each key encrypts one file.

Optional `zip:"DEF"` (raw DEFLATE before encrypt) shrinks a bundle dramatically (our ~640 KB example → ~20 KB) and the IG demo uses it — but modern `jose` dropped JWE `zip`, so DEF is a common failure point for third-party receivers. **Default to uncompressed** for links to unknown viewers; use DEF only when you control the receiver. The IG viewer inflates DEF.

### Retrieving the content

`recipient` (a display string naming who is opening the link) is **required** on every retrieval. Two rails:

- **Manifest** (default; required for multi-file, passcode, or any server-enforced control): the receiver `POST`s `{recipient, passcode?, embeddedLengthMax?}` to `url` and gets `{ files: [ { contentType, embedded | location } ] }`. Each file's **`contentType` is the *decrypted* payload type** — `application/fhir+json`, `application/smart-health-card`, or `application/smart-api-access` — **not** `application/jose` (that is only the HTTP type of a JWE body). Small files come back inline as `embedded`; larger ones as a short-lived `location` URL the receiver then fetches.
- **Direct file** (`flag` contains `U`): the receiver simply `GET`s `url?recipient=…`, body is the JWE (`Content-Type: application/jose`). **Single-file, and SHALL NOT carry a passcode.** Because a `GET` needs no server logic, a plain static object (S3 / GCS / Azure blob, a CDN or GitHub Pages file) is a compliant direct-file host — it returns the bytes and ignores the `?recipient` query. That is also its ceiling: a dumb host can't read `recipient`, count opens, or enforce `exp`, and it must send permissive CORS so a browser viewer can fetch cross-origin. Our demo *is* this — `example.jwe` is a static GitHub Pages file with `flag:"U"`.

Either way the receiver decrypts the JWE with `key` and parses the payload.

### Passcode (`flag` `P`)

A host-enforced second factor: the receiver supplies it in the manifest `POST`, and the host withholds the ciphertext unless it matches. The host SHALL bound incorrect attempts — on a wrong passcode return **`401` with a `{remainingAttempts}`** body, and **disable** the link once the budget is spent. Passcode is manifest-only (incompatible with the `U` rail).

## Sharing UX — present and manage the link

Treat a share as a **live, revocable object the user owns**, not a one-off export. Its lifecycle is **create → present → deliver → manage → take down**, and the sharing UI has two jobs. The rules below hold across app architectures (static, backed, client-only, mobile).

### Present the link — checklist

The shareable string is a **viewer URL + fragment**: `<viewer>/#shlink:/eyJ…`. The `#` fragment is never sent to the server (so the key never leaks into logs). The project's own viewer prefix is `https://periodicity.fhir.me/#shlink:/…`.

- [ ] **MUST render an on-screen QR** of that full string — error-correction level M, sized to scan from a phone, label visible (optionally the SMART logo). A bare `shlink:/…` only works with SHL-aware scanners; the viewer-prefixed form opens from any phone camera. *This is the primary in-person handoff and the step implementers most often skip — it is not optional.*
- [ ] **MUST offer copy-to-clipboard** of the identical string.
- [ ] **SHOULD offer the native share sheet** (`navigator.share()` / OS share) for remote delivery — message, email, paste into a portal.
- [ ] **SHOULD state in plain language** what's inside (data types + date range), that it's encrypted, and that anyone with the link can open it.

The QR and the copied/shared text are byte-identical: one minted link, two channels (scan vs. send).

### Manage the link — checklist

Because this is reproductive data, the user must stay in control after the link leaves their screen.

- [ ] **MUST provide a visible "Stop sharing / Take it down" action** that actually makes the link stop resolving — delete the ciphertext, disable the endpoint, or revoke server-side. Every architecture must support a real take-down.
- [ ] **MUST retain a handle to each live share** (the host URL / link id) so it can be revoked later. A fire-and-forget upload you cannot delete is not acceptable.
- [ ] **SHOULD show lifetime/expiry**, and where the host can count opens, **opens-remaining / use-limit**.
- [ ] **SHOULD list active shares** with status (created · last opened · expires · revoked).

Two automatic take-down triggers, both host-enforced and surfaced here: **after N opens** (needs a counting host) and **on expiry** (a countdown that is only real if the host stops serving at `exp`). The always-available manual trigger is **user revokes now**.

### Honesty rule

**Only surface a control the host actually enforces.** Don't show "2 opens left" if the host can't count GETs; don't imply auto-expiry a static object won't enforce. The link itself carries only an advisory `exp` — enforcement (expiry, use-count, revocation) is the *host's* job, so what you can promise in the UI is gated by where the ciphertext lives (next section).

## Choosing a host by the controls you need

Start from the controls you must honestly offer, then pick the host that can back them.

| Host | Real auto-expiry | Use-limit / count | Explicit revoke | Access visible | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Static object, no backend** (CDN / S3 / GCS / Azure, permissive CORS) | ✗ advisory only — must delete to enforce | ✗ blind host can't count | ✓ delete / overwrite / rotate key | ✗ | you just need to publish a snapshot the user can hand to a clinician |
| **Your own backend** (direct-file: `GET <url>?recipient=…` → `application/jose`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | clinic check-in, tighter operational control, production with no third party in the path |
| **shlep** (deployable blind SHLink service over any object store) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ pause / revoke | ✓ | client-only / static / mobile apps with no backend to enforce limits, revocation, passcode, or audit |

**Decision rule:** if the product promises use-limits, guaranteed revocation, passcode, or "opens remaining," a blind static host is insufficient — use a backend or deploy shlep. Static is fine for a plain snapshot, but you still owe the user a real take-down (delete the object) and must not display counters you cannot compute.

In all three, the privacy boundary holds: the host stores only ciphertext; the key stays client-side.

**shlep — a deployable blind SHLink service.** Use [shlep](https://github.com/jmandel/shlep) when the app can encrypt a Bundle but has no natural backend to host the ciphertext. It implements the SHLink data plane this guide needs (`GET /shl/{id}?recipient=…` → compact JWE; plus the manifest rail) and a capability-token control plane: create shares, add/replace/delete files, set expiry and max-use, set/clear a passcode, pause/resume, revoke, and read an access log — over ciphertext + a hashed manage token, never plaintext or the content key.

- Source + spec: https://github.com/jmandel/shlep (`docs/api-design.md`; a running instance self-documents at `GET /llms.txt`).
- Backends: any object store — S3, R2, GCS, Azure Blob, MinIO.

You deploy and operate it (no public hosted instance) — the right posture for production health data: you control retention, monitoring, and how manage tokens are issued.

## Implementing it yourself (no service)

If you'd rather not run a service, the client side is small. Use shlep's reference client crypto — `src/crypto.ts` (compact JWE `dir`/A256GCM, WebCrypto only) and `src/client.ts` (encrypt + compose the `shlink:/`) at https://github.com/jmandel/shlep — directly or translated; it uses a **fresh random IV per encryption and a fresh key per share** (the correct nonce discipline). For direct-file mode you then host the `.jwe` and hand out `<viewer>#shlink:/<payload>`.

The IG's own `viewer-src/jwe.mjs` is the viewer's **decrypt** path; `scripts/gen-shl.ts` is **editorial demo tooling** that pins a fixed key+IV only to keep the published example byte-stable — do not copy that pattern for real encryption.

## Receiver notes

- **Recipient flow:** scan/paste → extract `shlink:/` → decode → `GET <url>?recipient=...` → fetch JWE → decrypt with `key` → FHIR. Always send `recipient`; expect one-time/expiring links not to re-resolve.
- **Receiver hygiene:** fetch payload URLs through a hardened, SSRF-resistant retrieval path and treat decrypted content as untrusted input. Label the rendering clearly as patient-generated, not clinically attested.
